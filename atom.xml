<p>There is a difference between homework and studying.  Homework is assigned by the teacher and has specific instructions and a “due date”.  Studying is initiated by you – you determine what to study, when and where to do your studying and how long you are going to study the material covered in class.  You can maximize your potential by having a study schedule and knowing where to focus your efforts.</p>

<p>The purpose of this personal inventory is to help you become familiar with your study habits and attitudes.  It is intended to help you identify areas where you may wish to focus on improving your skills.  Read each statement and consider how it applies to you.  Keep track of your responses for each statement.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.iprepplus.com//images/global-citizen-img1.jpg" title="Bali Students" ></p>

<p>Technology has changed our world making it a global community – but not all citizens in this global community have access to the same educational opportunities to make their life better.  In a developed country, education is perceived as a “right” and not often valued, but in a third-world country education is seen as a “privilege” for those very few who can afford it.  This is definitely the case in the island of Bali, Indonesia.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://blog.iprepplus.com//images/global-citizen-img2.jpg" width="400" title="Bali Students" ></p>

<p>East Bali is the poorest part of the island where the average income is $100 per month – or about $3 a day.  Think about trying to support a family of six or more on $3 a day!  Although the Indonesian government provides free education in its government run schools, there are not schools in every village.  Families must pay for school supplies, transportation and at least three school uniforms for each child before a child can attend school.  It is no surprise that not all children – even from the same family –  can go to school when families are struggling to buy rice to eat, clothing for their family, and provide some sort of living accommodation.  Education is viewed as the ultimate privilege and certain pathway to a better life.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://blog.iprepplus.com//images/global-citizen-img3.jpg" width="400" title="Bali Students" ></p>

<p>In a global community we are all responsible for the well-being of each other.  Sequel Solutions Inc., through the sale of iPrep Plus Electronic Study Notes and Video Support resource packages, pledges to provide on-going financial support to enhance the educational opportunities for the children in East Bali.   The financial support goes to provide free after school and weekend classes for all children.  The Balinese teacher is provided and there is no cost to the families for the educational supplies and materials.  Children learn basic English, enhance their Math skills, practice reading and writing, and enjoy some cultural activities.</p>

<p>iPrep Plus provides students with <strong>unlimited access</strong> to an <strong>electronic Study Notes</strong> package and <strong>Video Support</strong> for the “tough topics” in English 30-1, Social Studies 30-1, Biology 30, Chemistry 30, Math 30-1, Math 30-2, Physics 30, and Science 30.  The resources can be used anytime, on any device, anywhere to support students in their day-to-day studies, class assignments, quizzes and unit or final tests.  Now that 70% of final grades are assigned by the school, it is more important than ever that students have access to quality materials to support their home study.</p>

<p>The <strong>electronic Study Notes</strong> of 50-150 pages provides a focused and comprehensive review of all course content.  The <strong>Video Support</strong>, comprised of five to ten minutes videos, deals with the “tough topics” of the course identifying common problems or errors students make, and providing a summary of helpful suggestions and hints to overcome and master the challenges.  The best news about <em>iPrep Plus</em> is that students can have <strong>immediate and unlimited access</strong> to all this for <strong>the same cost as one hour of traditional tutoring</strong>!!</p>
